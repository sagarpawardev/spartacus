# Spartacus Tracking Library

Spartacus' tracking library offers a various set of features related to support support, e.g. the TMS support (including the support for Adobe Launch, GTM, etc.).

It can be added to the existing Spartacus application by running `ng add @spartacus/tracking`. For more information about Spartacus schematics, visit the [official Spartacus schematics documentation page](https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/schematics/).
